# Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**: Group imports by type (React, third-party, local)
- **Formatting**: Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Components**: Use functional components with React hooks
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for global state
- **TypeScript**: Define interfaces for props and state; use strict typing
- **Styling**: Use MUI components with custom styling and Tailwind utilities
- **Animations**: Use Framer Motion for animations with defined variants
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks with console.error logging
- **Naming**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions
- **File Structure**: One component per file; group related components in folders
- **Responsiveness**: Use MUI's responsive styling with xs/sm breakpoints

# Testing Notes
- Test components with different states and responsive views
- Verify animations and transitions work smoothly
